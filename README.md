# DSA Practice

This repository contains my personal implementations and practice problems related to data structures and algorithms in C++.

### Folder Structure

- `primitive_ds/linked_list/` – Linked list implementations and problems
- `stacks_queues/` – Stack and queue-related problems (to be added)
- `sorting_algorithms/` – Basic sorting algorithm implementations

### Notes

- All code is written in C++.
- Organized by topic as I learn and practice.
- CMake is used for building some projects.

This is mainly for personal use and learning.
